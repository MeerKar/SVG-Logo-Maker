## Introduction

This project is to build Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an [SVG file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics). The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a `.svg` file.


## Problem

A number of test fails and understanding the concepts of OOP and usage of constructor functions in code was a bit of challenging. 


## Solution
After a number test failures i could successfully  pass the test and able to generate the logo sucessfully giving correct prompt using inqurirer.
